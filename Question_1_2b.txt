Observations:
	1.	With Regularization:
	•	Smoother training curve and improved validation performance.
	•	Final test accuracy increased from ~46% to ~50.53%, showing better generalization.
	2.	Without Regularization:
	•	Higher training accuracy variance and lower validation accuracy due to overfitting.
	3.	Weight Norm:
	•	Regularization kept weight norms smaller (~4.3), reducing overfitting.

Conclusion:

Regularization improved generalization, reducing overfitting and increasing test accuracy, demonstrating its effectiveness in this image classification task.
